## Wakanda Setup & Description  
**What is Wakanda?**  
Think of it like you are a special agent and you are trying to help secure the Marvel Paradise of Wakanda. We all know that they mine Vibranium right? But there are dangers lurking around every corner.  
  
**Wakanda Description:**  
"A new Vibranium market will soon be online in the dark net. Your goal, get your hands on the root file containing the exact location of the mine."  
  
**Wakanda Flags:**  
There are 3 Known flags inside the VM (flag1.txt, flag2.txt, root.txt)  
Our mission is to collect all 3 of these flags!  
The only intel you are allowed to have is;  
* DHCP: Enable This  
* IP Address: Automatically Assign This  
* Follow Your Intuitions  
* And Remember to Enumerate!  
**Happy Hacking**
